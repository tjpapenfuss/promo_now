Well I have been working with Joe on my alignment of the surface platform to deliver the FoF platform for the enterprise data teams. I also talked with Jim and we talked through the vision of our program. This helped to put us on the right direction. Finally, I had a solid output this afternoon. I was able to get my code working for the LLM that I am building. This will help our organizion with the start of our app.
